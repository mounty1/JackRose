Spaced Repetition Software as a web service
===========================================

Project status:  **alpha**.  You can run it if you are prepared to do some work.  In particular, you'll
need a running Postgres server and will have to run SQL insert statements.

[Building and running instructions](sandbox/README.md)

Implemented using the Yesod framework.

As this is a learning exercise for the author:
- It is likely that best practice is not followed in some areas.
- Code will be rewritten in progressively higher-level constructions.
- Patches and comments are welcome, provided they are explained.
- The Yesod scaffolding system is not of interest.
