		<p>JackRose is a new entry in the spaced repetition software category.</p>

		<p>It is not intended to be especially simple, or easy for non-technical people to use.
		If you want a simple system, you are invited to consider <a href="http://ankisrs.net">Anki</a>.
		This advice is not flippant or sarcastic;  JackRose
		requires some computer expertise to set up and is not suitable for newcomers.</p>

		<p>In contrast to the small personal systems that currently dominate the SRS arena,
		JackRose is designed to handle large data sets efficiently.  It is borne of the
		author's assessment that the existing SRSs don't scale well to 100s of users
		with ten of thousands of learnt items.</i>

		<p>The name has no particular significance;  Jack and Rose are two English words that have multiple
		meanings;  that is all.  It is pronounced with the stress on the first syllable.</p>

		The main distinguishing features are:
		<ul>
			<li>It is a web application.  This avoids having to implement a user interface, but it also
				satisfies the design aim of a large-scale system, in that it can be centrally administered
				and access granted or denied securely.  Unlike other web-based SRSs however, it is entirely
				open;  anyone with the knowledge and means can install and run their own JackRose server.</li>

			<li>Open data:  in contrast to systems that require learning data to be imported into their
				own database, JackRose connects to external data sources, which (currently) can be SQLite3
				tables, Postgres tables, or tab-separated flat files.  The only requirement is that each data record
				have a unique and unchanging key.  This allows a business or other organisation to
				maintain, for example, a lexicon (``foreign-language dictionary'') and JackRose will use
				the `live' data from it and won't require a periodic refresh or re-import.
				Similarly, media (sound and video files) can be organised according to the wishes
				of the user, and do not have to be imported into the application.</li>
		</ul>

		The main implementation features are:
		<ul>
			<li>It implements the Anki concept of separate data (notes, in Anki parlance) and learnt items
				(cards in Anki parlance;  really, views on the data).</li>

			<li>Written in Haskell;  one clear research finding is that dynamically-typed languages suffer from
				exponential maintenance complexity and that strong static type checking is an important
				tool of software engineering to achieve higher reliability.  This of course precludes the
				Anki model of add-ons (monkey patching) and JackRose must provide user-customisable
				behaviour either by configuration options or by source modification.  Modern DVCSs
				allow the preservation of user customisations when source is updated or pulled.</li>

			<li>Importing data is achieved simply by specifying a new data source, having previously
				used bulk load etc. to populate the source.</li>

			<li>Configurable spacing algorithms;  this is to determine, for a particular learner, which
				is the most `efficient' algorithm;  be it SM-2, SM-<i>x</i>, Leitner or ANN.</li>

			<li>The business model is that the software is open-source (free) but that you can choose to
				pay for hosting (which means that you only need a browser to perform
				daily repetitions) and consultancy.</li>
		</ul>
