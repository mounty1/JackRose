Spaced Repetition Software as a web service
===========================================

Implemented using the Yesod framework.

Haddock:  http://www.landcroft.com/jackrose/documentation/index.html

As this is a learning exercise for the author:
 * It is likely that best practice is not followed in some areas.
 * Patches and comments are welcome, provided they are explained.
 * The Yesod scaffolding system is not of interest.

The current version is always running at https://jackrose.landcroft.com
but all it does so far is allow you to register via email and log in.

RUNNING JACKROSE
================

The phases required are:

1.  Downloading and installing the building software;  mainly ghc and
some platform-specific tools.
2.  Downloading and building JackRose itself.
3.  Running JackRose.
4.  Connecting to JackRose from a web browser.


THE DETAIL

These notes are from memory and are most likely incomplete;  please send suggestions
and errata to {the project name} at landcroft dot com.


1  The building software

1.1  On Centos 7

Use Halcyon:  https://halcyon.sh/

Halcyon is great;  it Just Works and the developer Mietek is very helpful and friendly.

# cd JackRose/source
# halcyon install

1.2  On Gentoo

emerge ghc cabal


1.3  Ubuntu, Mess Windoze etc.

Although I've not tried it, I presume the Haskell platform https://www.haskell.org/platform/
is the way to go here.


2  Downloading and building JackRose itself.

$ git clone https://github.com/mounty1/JackRose.git
$ cd JackRose/source
$ cabal update
$ cabal install --builddir=gentoo

Then cabal install the missing/required packages.
The idea of that builddir option is that if you are building from the same tree on Centos 7
then Halcyon uses the default dist/ directory which should be entirely separate from the
build on other platforms.


3  Running JackRose.

$ cd JackRose/site
Modify jackrose.cfg to taste.
$ mv mounty.cfg {yourloginname}.cfg
When you connect to JackRose, you will have to set up an account.
Currently, the only way of configuring your account is to have a server-side configuration
file of the same name as your login.
You are doing this step before you have logged-in;  i.e., before you have actually created
the account.
Modify {yourloginname}.cfg to taste.

Finally, run JackRose
Centos7# /app/platform/JackRose -c ./jackrose.cfg
Gentoo$ ../source/gentoo/dist/JackRose/JackRose -c ./jackrose.cfg


4  Connecting to JackRose from a web browser.

In the simple case, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000

Then create your account, using the same login as the configuration XML you just modified.
You should then see the question item as set up in your configuration XML.
So far, that's all it does.
